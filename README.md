## The whole story
In 2014 I started working at EverythingMe.

On my first day @omribahumi called me Shalom Hayafyuf (Pretty boy), and I didn't pay too much attention for that.

Later that day @bergundy looked at me and said what a "Yafyuf". I was really flattered but it was weird, I'm not that pretty.

Only few days later Omri showed me [Tzabari Brothers' youtube clip](https://youtu.be/mk_qRtdCbXE?t=248), with a character called Shalom Hayafyuf.

Since then, thousands of people acknowledged this nickname.
